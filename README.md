This is to backup my files while I work on creating a basic platformer.
The goal at the end is to have a working example with a fully-featured game loop, music, SFX, and GFX.


Current progress can be played here:
[Basic platformer example](https://lukeeingram.com/godot-example/)

Controls: 
- WASD or arrow keys to move the character
- W or the up arrow makes the character jump

You can goomba stomp the enemies to kill them and reach new heights!

Thanks for checking out my project.
